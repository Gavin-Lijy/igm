How to create the parallel environment and submit a successful parallel IGM calculation.

 - ```bash create_ipcluster_environment.sh```: this will submit the controller and create the ```submit_engines``` script, ready for you to submit.
 - Wait for the controller job to start (and generate its own ```out`` and `err` files), and then submit the engines with ```qsub submit_engines```.
 - When the engines are also running, you can submit the actual IGM calculation on top of the (controller + engines) scaffold, wich ```qsub submit_igm```
