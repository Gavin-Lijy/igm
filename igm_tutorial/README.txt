The IGM optimization is not working,
this is probably because we only have 5 structures,
and we are trying to optimize the HiC data.

Next time, we can silence the HiC data,
and run IGM only with the Speckle data.

We have a path issue: it doesn't find the speckles.pkl file.
We tried looking at how this problem was solved for .hcs data,
but for now we haven't been able to solve it.
